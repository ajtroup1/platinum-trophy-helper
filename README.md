# platinum-trophy-helper

This is an app that tracks my games that ive played
this is hosted on a heroku database, so you have to run the program.cs to load the data from sql
this program prioritazes full-stack development over css / styling, so it looks very basic
to start, open gameslist.html (the 'home' page) and dotnet watch run the program.cs

TO-DO:
    Add achievements button / update database
